# Use of ML Algorithms and ANN for Diabetes Detection

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on detecting diabetes using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). A dataset from Kaggle was used, followed by data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering. Five ML models were trained and compared before implementing an ANN for improved accuracy.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- **Preprocessing steps:**  
  - Data cleaning  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Splitting into train and test sets  

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Models Used  
1. **Logistic Regression**  
2. **Random Forest**  
3. **Decision Tree**  
4. **Naïve Bayes**  
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

Each model's accuracy was evaluated and compared using graphical visualizations.

## 🔥 Deep Learning Approach (ANN)  
- Implemented an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
- Initially trained with **10 epochs**, then increased the epochs for better accuracy  

## 📊 Performance Evaluation  
- Accuracy comparison of ML models

## 🌐 Deployment  
- This project was hosted on **Streamlit** for interactive visualization.  
- The code for deployment is included in the repository.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)  
  - Scikit-Learn (ML Models)  
  - TensorFlow/Keras (ANN Implementation)  
  - Streamlit (Web App Deployment)  

## 🏁 Conclusion  
This project successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of different ML algorithms in detecting diabetes and highlights the potential of ANN for improved accuracy.
